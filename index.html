        No More Homeless,
        No More Hunger
      </h2>
      <p>Many people conflate hunger and homelessness. Although the issues are closely related, there are several
        important distinctions we need to be aware of. For starters, a person does not have to be experiencing homeless
        to be hungry. More than 42 million Americans are food insecure, meaning they don’t have access to an adequate
        supply of nutritious, affordable food.

        Give Someone’s Life
        By Giving Of Yours
      </h2>
      <p>One study suggests that we’re less likely to want to help groups because people find the needs of larger groups
        to be emotionally overwhelming. To prevent these emotional costs, people tamp down their emotions and numb their
        compassion and sense of connection to members of the large group.However, this study also found that this
        compassion collapse effect can be counteracted by preemptively and
        explicitly instructing people to feel their emotions rather than trying to regulate them.</p>
